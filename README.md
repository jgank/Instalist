Want to make your significant other happy on Valentine's day? Need help creating a Christmas list after Thanksgiving dinner? Do you ever have trouble coming up with gifts that you would actually like? Instalist can effortlessly guide you to generate a custom holiday wish list. As seen in the famous Tinder app, the user must swipe right or left to like or dislike an item. This setup was made famous for dating is now being introduced in online retail! Once the user selects the right amount of liked items, her or she can sendoff the holiday gift list via email, text message, a Facebook post, or Tweet. Unlike Tinder, the app offers the option to go back to the previously swiped items to reevaluate the likeness. The app is designed to show a broad range of products that should expose the user to many likable products. It is very straightforward and to the point; only two questions are asked to set your display preferences and then you are off! If you see something you want right away, you can tap on the image on the main screen or in the list view to purchase the product in the featured online retail store. Want to add a known product to your list, just tap the button on the bottom right and paste the URL to add products from any website! One final feature in included in the app is the ability live chat with Justin Knag the app creator. Feel free to talk about anything from help with app to suggestions for gift ideas.
